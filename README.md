### Double\-Ka\-Meetha

Double\-ka\-meetha is a famous Indian sweet, most commonly served as a dessert in Hyderabad and its surroundings. It is basically a **bread pudding** of fried bread slices **soaked in hot sugar syrup and milk**. It is a popular food item in most of the Hyderabadi cuisines and served at weedings and parties. I like it the most because of its soft and syrupy texture besides the sweetness.

## Code Fencing

> "GameMaker accommodates the creation of cross-platform and multi-genre video games using a custom drag-and-drop visual programming language or a scripting language known as Game Maker Language, which can be used to develop more advanced games that could not be created just by using the drag and drop features. GameMaker was originally designed to allow novice computer programmers to be able to make computer games without much programming knowledge by use of these actions. Recent versions of software also focus on appealing to advanced developers."
