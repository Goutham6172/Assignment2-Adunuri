### Double\-Ka\-Meetha

Double\-ka\-meetha is a famous Indian sweet, most commonly served as a dessert in Hyderabad and its surroundings. It is basically a **bread pudding** of fried bread slices **soaked in hot sugar syrup and milk**. It is a popular food item in most of the Hyderabadi cuisines and served at weedings and parties. I like it the most because of its soft and syrupy texture besides the sweetness.
